# QtTracks - working version

QtTracks is an PyQt5 app developed for an analysis of fission track data derived from both external detector and LA-ICP-MS methods. 

Options available in current (working version):
* Calculation of single grain ages (both external detector and LA-ICP-MS methods)
* Calculation of central and pooled ages (both external detector and LA-ICP-MS methods)
* Calculation of the mean track length
* Age data plots (Ns vs Ni, Age vs DPar, KDE plot, Radial plot)
* Track length histogram

Options that will be added soon:
* Track length projection
* Chi2 statistics
* Saving data as a pdf report
